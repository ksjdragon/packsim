Width Diagrams
==============

This script compiles the simulation results into their relevant diagrams. Specifically, given *Search* simulation files at desired widths, it will compile the data and output the diagrams.

To run it, you need only provide the folder of *Search* simulations:

.. code-block:: bash

	(.venv) /path/to/squish: width_diagrams /path/to/my/searches

Then, it will process and generate diagrams in the `figures` folder.
